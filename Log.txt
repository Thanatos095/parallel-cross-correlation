Before (no optimization)
110000



After applying "omp parallel for collapse(n)" 
70000



After removing file read/write
35000


 
After further optimization (combinining parallel regions)  - E80
17000


Optimizing gray_scale function with dynamic scheduling. Chunk size 30.
Very slight marginal improvement. (about 100ms) 


After measuring by running EXE file directly:
8500 - 9000


-> Replaced manual summing with reduction in gaussian blur 
no observable change


Measuring directly from EXE after removing optimizations:
30000 - 32000



attempted to replace "for" with "sections" in pad_2D.
overall time increased by about 500ms


Explciitly defined threads using omp_set_thread_num() to 16. 
No signfiicant effect
